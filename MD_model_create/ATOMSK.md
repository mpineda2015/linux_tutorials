- First lets install it on Aristotle 
1. open a terminal to Aristotle and connect in addition with WinSCP (if on mac you can use )
2. go to the GitHUB repository and clone the repository locally like so: 
```shell
git clone git@github.com:pierrehirel/atomsk.git
```

3. now cd into the new folder `% cd atomsk`
4. you can view the `README` file using WinSCP viewer or the terminal using `less README ` (remember to click q to exit `less` when you finish)
5. according to the readme file, to install we need to enter the src folder and do `make atomsk` this will run the GFORTRAN compiler and compile the code producing the executable ATOMSK which we will add to the path like so: 
6. add the line `export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/atomsk/src` (replace ucqsaha with your user name! ) to the end of the file ` .bashrc` which is in your home folder. (hint: `nano ~/.bashrc`) then save and run the following in the terminal `% . ~/.bashrc` to activate the change. now if you type `%atomsk -h` you will get a message referring you to the ATOMSK website for information, this is a sign that the code is running well.
